# Neural Style Transfer


Neural Style Transfer is a technique that uses deep learning to compose one image in the style of another image. Have your ever wished you could paint like Picasso or Van Gogh? This is your chance!

### A Few Examples
-------------------
* The beautiful ruins of the ancient city of Persepolis (Iran) with the style of Van Gogh (The Starry Night)

* The tomb of Cyrus the great in Pasargadae with the style of a Ceramic Kashi from Ispahan

## Transfer Learning
------
Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.

Following the original [NST paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), I have used the VGG network. Specifically, VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the earlier layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers)
